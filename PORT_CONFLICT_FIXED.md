# ✅ **PORT CONFLICT RESOLVED**

## 🎉 **ISSUE FIXED**

---

## ❌ **ERROR: Port Already in Use**

### **Error Message:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Server was already running on port 5000
- Nodemon tried to restart and create another instance
- Port conflict occurred

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION**

Killed the existing process using PowerShell:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Shows connections in TIME_WAIT state (closing down)
```

---

## 🚀 **HOW TO RESTART SERVER**

### **Option 1: Just type `rs` in the terminal**
Since nodemon is watching for changes, simply type:
```
rs
```
And press Enter. Nodemon will restart cleanly.

---

### **Option 2: Restart completely**
```bash
# Stop current process (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
pnpm run dev
```

---

## 📝 **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

When server starts successfully, you should see:
```
⚠️  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY not configured. Payment features will use mock mode.
   Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to your .env file to enable real payments.
Socket service initialized
MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Server running on port 5000
Environment: development
Allowed CORS origins: http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, ...
```

---

## 🔧 **IF PORT CONFLICT HAPPENS AGAIN**

### **Quick Fix (Windows):**
```powershell
# Find process on port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill all node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Or kill specific PID
taskkill /F /PID <PID_NUMBER>
```

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS**

- ✅ Stripe configuration fixed
- ✅ SMS service in mock mode
- ✅ Port conflict resolved
- ✅ Server ready to start

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. Type `rs` in your server terminal
2. Server should start on port 5000
3. Visit: http://localhost:5000
4. Test API endpoints
